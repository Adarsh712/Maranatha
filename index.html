  <p><em>So Abram went, as the LORD had told him….. (He was 75 Years old)</em></p>
  <p>The land where they started living, the land which God showed him…. There was a FAMINE… What a great start… He has left everything and travelled to this land just because of a call… and now He couldn’t live in it… There is no food… </p>
  <p><strong>For a moment He would have thought…</strong> Should I go back to my Father’s House… Have I really heard the voice of the Lord… OR was it my imagination…? Because its not going as I thought it would…</p>
  <p>He went to Egypt to live there as a <i>sojourner</i>… When He was about to enter Egypt, he said to Sarai His wife, “I know that you are a woman beautiful in appearance, and when the Egyptians see you, they will say, ‘This is his wife.’ Then they
    will <i>kill me</i>, but they will let you live. Say you are my sister, that it may go well with me because of you, and that my life may be spared for your sake.” (verse 11,12,13)</p>
  <p>At this point you can tell… His life is not going very well… He is a sojourner and don’t know whether he will <i>make it alive</i> out of Egypt or not…</p>
  <p>So, at the start of the chapter God calls him out of Haran and He obeys God <em>and now…</em>
  <ul>
    <li>He is a sojourner</li>
    <li>Afraid that Egyptians will kill him</li>
    <li>Lying that his wife is His SISTER</li>
    <li>• His wife is taken to Pharaoh’s house</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <p>Things not going his way… Definitely not the way he thought, after hearing all those blessings listed at the start of the chapter… (I will make you a great name, great nation etc..) </p>
  <p><em>Did He regret His decision to leave his father’s house??? Is this ‘the valley of the shadow of death’ David talks about???</em> I don’t know… What I know is… when Abram was in his tent… doing nothing… <em>His God was working for him…</em>
    “The Lord afflicted Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai” (verse 17) and Pharaoh calls Abram and says, “here is your wife; take her, and go.” ( Remember all the sheep, oxen, male donkeys, male servants, female servants,
    female donkeys, and camels that he took from Pharaoh in verse 16…LOL) </p>
  <p><strong><em>How astonishingly God changed the circumstances into Abram’s Favor…WOW… That is God of Abraham… He is Faithful to his promise… </em></strong>I know the promise is not fulfilled… So lets go to the next chapter and see what happens
    next…</p>
